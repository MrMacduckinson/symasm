This VS Code extension translates x86 assembler to symcode — the term from this article: https://habr.com/ru/articles/840070/.

The core is the repo by the author of the article: https://github.com/symasm/symasm.

To translate x86 assembler to symcode you open .txt with assembler, open Command Palette, and run *Translate assembler to symcode*. You will get the text file in .symcode format with the symcode.
